<h1>The Best Video Games According to Alex</h1>
<h2>My top 3 games of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Street Fighter 6</h3>
<p>The Street Fighter series has paved the way for fighting games and has been at the top since the start. The reason I love this franchise is because it pushes you to be better by accepting failure and defeat. It teaches you that these are only steps you must overcome to be succesful at something. The game also allows for self expression in various ways such as the character you play and how you play them. Street Fighter 6 has been my gateway into the FGC and I have had a blast playing and learning this beatiful game.</p>
<h3>Soulsborne Series</h3>
<p>The soulsborne series is a group of games made by the developer FromSoftware. The list is made up of Demon Souls, Dark Souls 1-3, and Bloodborne. These games similar to fighting games push you to not give up and persevere in order to accomplish your goals. These games are very difficult and set in dark and unsettling worlds full of dread and misery they always give you a sense of hopelessness when played. However, when you defeat a boss or get past a hard area it fills you with a rush knowing that you overcame the hardships.</p>
<h3>Kingdom Hearts Series</h3>
<p>The Kingdom Hearts games are a crossover of the Final Fantasy and Disney universes. They are mostly action rpgs with an emphasis on narrative storytelling and accelerant gameplay. They can be difficult at times if played on the Proud setting which is a must in my opinion as you get the full story as well as more unique weapons and items playing this way. These games are all about standing up agains the forces of evil and not allowing the darkness in our souls to overcome us. They highlight the importance of having friends and families that stand by you but more importantly that you stand by them. These games are a graphic delicacy and the music is also amazing. If you are a fan of great games that leave a mark on you this is it.</p>
